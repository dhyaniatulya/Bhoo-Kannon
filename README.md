Bhoo-kannon of uttarakhand 

What is Bhoo-Kanon 
Bhoo Kanun is the land law of Uttarakhand. It is a complex and controversial issue, with many different stakeholders involved. The main goal of the Bhoo Kanun is to protect the interests of the local people, while also encouraging investment and development in the state.

Enacted in 2016, the Bho Kanoon serves as a legal framework for managing land ownership and transactions in the state. Its core objectives encompass:

Prioritizing local residents: The law prioritizes Uttarakhand natives in land ownership matters, aiming to safeguard their rights and prevent uncontrolled land acquisition by outsiders.
Curbing land grabbing: The legislation strives to combat land grabbing practices, ensuring fair and transparent land deals for all stakeholders.
Preserving agricultural land: Recognizing the significance of agriculture for the stateâ€™s economy and environment, the Bho Kanoon seeks to protect and preserve agricultural land by restricting its conversion for non-agricultural purposes.
In 2002, a regulation was instituted restricting individuals from other states to purchase land in Uttarakhand, limiting it to parcels of up to 500 square meters. However, in 2007, this threshold was reduced to 250 square meters.

The Bhoo Kanun has been criticized by some for being too restrictive. They argue that it prevents investment and development in the state and that it discriminates against non-residents. Others argue that the Bhoo Kanun is necessary to protect the interests of the local people, who are already facing a shortage of land.
